NTH = Nice-to-Have

Non-dependent Interface steps:
 - [x] Code view
   - [x] Update font to look like code.
   - [x] Adjust buttons as: <strike>compile</strike> load, run/continue (same or two buttons), break/step (same or two buttons)
   - [ ] Add listeners for the following:
     - [x] onFileLoad
     - [ ] onRun
     - [ ] onBreak
     - [ ] onStep
   - [ ] NTH -> highlight the line of the current PC
   - [ ] NTH -> line numbers
 - [x] Registry view
   - [x] Make it smaller.
   - [ ] Add labels/text boxes for - r0...r7, sp, pc, flags
   - [ ] NTH -> make register labels/text boxes editable and onEdit will have listener(s) (cpu update)
   - [ ] Either:
     - [ ] setValues(regs...)
     - [ ] setValue(reg, value)
     - [ ] init() retains registers and update() re-reads
 - [x] Flags view
   - [ ] Decompose flags in a label/text box each. Update from reg view
 - [x] Memory section
   - [ ] A lot of labels for ram
   - [ ] Line edit / value for offset in RAM. Will not fit all RAM
   - [ ] init() to hook to ram, update() hook to re-read
 - [ ] Keyboard/Keypad
   - [ ] Numerical initially
   - [ ] init() link to kb peripheral
 - [ ] Display
   - [ ] Label, init() to hook, update() to re-read
 - [ ] Simulator component
   - [ ] Runs the cpu endlessly, like tester. At run
   - [ ] Starts in break
   - [ ] step calls onStep (obviously)
   - [ ] run starts a thread that steps endlessly.
   - [ ] break stops the thread
   - [ ] linked to Code View
